# Video 1: AI vs ML vs DL

## Key Definitions

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- **Definition**: Simulation of human intelligence in machines
- **Goal**: Make machines think and act like humans
- **Scope**: Broadest field encompassing all intelligent behavior
- **Examples**: 
  - Chatbots
  - Game playing (Chess, Go)
  - Recommendation systems
  - Virtual assistants

### Machine Learning (ML)
- **Definition**: Subset of AI that learns from data without explicit programming
- **Goal**: Enable machines to learn patterns from data
- **Scope**: Narrower than AI, focuses on learning algorithms
- **Examples**:
  - Email spam detection
  - Stock price prediction
  - Image recognition
  - Customer segmentation

### Deep Learning (DL)
- **Definition**: Subset of ML using artificial neural networks with multiple layers
- **Goal**: Mimic human brain structure for complex pattern recognition
- **Scope**: Narrowest, specific technique within ML
- **Examples**:
  - Image classification
  - Natural language processing
  - Speech recognition
  - Autonomous vehicles

## Key Differences

| Aspect | AI | ML | DL |
|--------|----|----|-----|
| **Data Requirement** | Varies | Medium to Large | Very Large |
| **Computational Power** | Varies | Moderate | High |
| **Human Intervention** | High | Medium | Low |
| **Interpretability** | Varies | Medium | Low (Black Box) |
| **Problem Solving** | Rule-based + Learning | Pattern-based | Feature extraction automatic |

## When to Use What?

### Use AI when:
- Need rule-based systems
- Expert knowledge available
- Interpretability is crucial

### Use ML when:
- Have structured data
- Clear patterns exist
- Need interpretable results

### Use DL when:
- Large datasets available
- Complex patterns (images, text, audio)
- High computational resources
- Accuracy > Interpretability

## Quick Revision Points

- **AI** = Intelligence simulation (broadest)
- **ML** = Learning from data (subset of AI)
- **DL** = Neural networks with multiple layers (subset of ML)
- **Hierarchy**: AI ⊃ ML ⊃ DL
- **Data needs**: DL > ML > AI (generally)
- **Complexity**: DL > ML > Traditional AI
